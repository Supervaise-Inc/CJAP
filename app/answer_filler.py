"""P3 dynamic filler — a question-relevant thinking-aloud sentence.

Design (hybrid, latency-safe): the FIRST filler is always a canned clip from
~/fillers (zero latency). While it plays, this module generates ONE short
in-persona sentence acknowledging the question's topic (Haiku) and voices it
(same TTS voice as live speech), then injects it as the NEXT filler clip via
FillerLoop.inject(). Generation typically lands in 2-4s — inside the first
clip + gap — so it can never delay first filler audio or the real answer.

Dark behind CJ_DYNAMIC_FILLER=1. Every failure is silent-open: the loop just
keeps playing canned clips.

# Filler length is LATENCY (2026-09-12, user: "can we make things real time").
# The answer cannot start until the filler stops speaking, so every filler word
# is a word the visitor waits. Measured that day: fillers came back 11-20 words
# = 4-7 s of speech, while the answer itself was often ready in 3-4 s. The cap
# was 14 words; 7 costs ~2-3 s less per turn and still covers the gap.
# CJ_FILLER_MAX_WORDS raises it again if the robot starts sounding clipped.
