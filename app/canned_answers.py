"""Canned fast path: hand-written answers for common questions.

A matched question skips STT->route->compose entirely and speaks a curated
answer through the normal TTS path — the ElevenLabs clip cache makes every
repeat play instantly at zero token cost.

The answer file is data/entities/canned_answers.json (env CJ_CANNED_PATH),
hand-editable and mtime hot-reloaded like the entity overlay and gate rules:

    {"entries": [{"id": "...",
                  "match": ["<regex>", ...],   # fullmatch vs normalized text
                  "answer": "..."              # or "answers": ["...", ...]
                 }, ...]}

Matching is deliberately conservative: the WHOLE normalized question must
match one of the entry's regexes (re.fullmatch). Loose keyword matching would
hijack real questions — when in doubt, let the composer answer.

Exception — event mode (2026-08-25, user: "make the event script a bit
flexible"): while the event flag is on, the scripted event_* entries also
match PARAPHRASES of their question, so the emcee need not read the script
word for word. Two extra tests, after the wake/greeting prefix is stripped:
  "gist": [[alt, ...], ...]   every concept group must appear (word-prefix
                              search), and the question must be short
                              (<= EVENT_GIST_MAX_WORDS)
  fuzzy                       difflib ratio >= EVENT_FUZZY_RATIO against one
                              of the entry's "ask" phrasings (STT wobble)
The answers themselves stay verbatim.

Enable with CJ_CANNED_ENABLED=1. Every public function fails open (returns
None / False); a canned-path bug must never break a spoken turn.
