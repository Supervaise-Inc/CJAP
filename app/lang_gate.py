"""Transcript language gate (2026-08-25, user: "strictly limit to Filipino
and English words in transcribing").

The STT API takes ONE language hint, and under room noise it hallucinates
whole sentences in random languages (Dutch, Hungarian, Latin seen in the
journal). This gate lets English, Filipino (Tagalog) and Taglish through and
rejects everything else. Two layers, cheapest first:

  1. vocabulary evidence — share of words found in a built-in English +
     Tagalog common-word set, the pronunciation lexicon (corpus Tagalog,
     names, places) and the entity dictionary (cases, people);
  2. langdetect (n-gram model) on the sentence: accepted when English or
     Tagalog is the top guess or together carry >= 35% probability.

Very short utterances (< 3 words) are always accepted — too little signal
to judge, and they are usually "Sige po." / "Yes." Fails OPEN on any error.
Disable with CJ_STT_LANG_STRICT=0.
