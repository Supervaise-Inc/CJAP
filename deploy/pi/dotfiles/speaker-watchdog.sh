# speaker-watchdog - keep robot audio on a Bluetooth speaker whenever one is
# connected, otherwise on the internal XMOS speaker, so the robot is never mute.
#
# Priority (first usable wins): Sony ULT FIELD 1, then Marshall EMBERTON.
# "Usable" = bluetoothctl says Connected AND BlueALSA exposes its A2DP PCM
# (a speaker can be "connected" with no audio endpoint yet -> would be mute).
# Route mechanics live in ~/bin/audio-out (rewrites ~/.asoundrc.route; only
# newly opened playback streams follow a switch, i.e. the next utterance).
# To force the internal speaker while a BT speaker is on, stop this service
# first: sudo systemctl stop speaker-watchdog
# 2026-08-26: generalised from Sony-only to both paired speakers + PCM check.
