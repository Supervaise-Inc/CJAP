"""speech_engines — STT + TTS engines for the CJ robot.

* transcribe_openai(): OpenAI transcription (OPENAI_STT_MODEL) with the persona
  steering prompt and echo guard.
* tts_elevenlabs_wav(): the cloned ElevenLabs voice via the repo-root voice/
  package (clip cache, alignment sidecar, request stitching); emotion speed
  deltas, slew and limits; farewell_settings().
* OpenAI tts-1 chain (tts_concatenate_parallel & co): the fallback used by
  main_voice_robot.speak() and SentenceSpeaker._synth when ElevenLabs fails.

#   1. system PATH (operator installed ffmpeg system-wide)
#   2. static-ffmpeg's bundled pair (pip install static-ffmpeg) —
#      ships BOTH ffmpeg.exe AND ffprobe.exe, unlike imageio-ffmpeg.
#   3. imageio-ffmpeg's bundled ffmpeg (NO ffprobe — concat works
#      but MP3 duration measurement falls through to mutagen).
#
# Post-mortem 2026-06-09: the prior tier (imageio-ffmpeg only) gave
# us ffmpeg without ffprobe, which silently broke pydub's
# AudioSegment.from_file mid-turn — the concatenation path used in
# _concatenate_mp3_chunks() shells out to ffprobe and crashes on
# Windows when ffprobe is absent. static-ffmpeg fixes that.

# rest of the discovery (shutil.which) picks both up uniformly.
