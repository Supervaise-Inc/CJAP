"""Pre-render every canned answer into the ElevenLabs clip cache so the FIRST
ask of each common question plays instantly. Mirrors the classic speak() path
exactly (entity TTS pass, then base-speed synth) so the cache key matches.

Run from the repo root:  app/.venv/bin/python scripts/prerender_canned.py
Re-run after editing data/entities/canned_answers.json (only new/changed
answers cost credits — unchanged ones are cache hits).
