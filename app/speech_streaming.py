"""Streaming first-sentence speech for the kiosk (2026-08-12).

Instead of compose-everything -> synth-everything -> play, this streams
Sonnet's answer, cuts it into sentences as tokens arrive, synthesizes each
sentence (one ahead), and starts PLAYING as soon as the first sentence's
audio is ready — first audio lands during composition of the rest.

Used by main_voice_robot.handle_turn for every composed answer; main_voice_robot.speak()
whole-answer path remains the fallback. Fail behavior: any error raises to
the caller, which owns the offline/bail handling.

Sentence splitting is citation-aware: never splits after abbreviations like
"v." (Lambino v. Comelec), "Mr.", "G.R.", initials, etc.
