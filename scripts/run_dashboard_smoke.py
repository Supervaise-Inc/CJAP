"""P2.5 benchmark — dashboard responsiveness against the LIVE server on :8080.

Measures, repeatably:
  * event-to-visible latency: writes a labeled note into the transcript feed
    and polls /api/state until it appears (the number both views' freshness
    depends on),
  * /api/state fetch latency (p50/p95 over 20 fetches),
  * camera: /api/camera.jpg fetch time, frame size, and effective refresh rate
    over 3 seconds,
  * page weights (audience/maintain must stay lightweight for the demo LAN).

Writes reports/dashboard_smoke.json. Exit 1 if any check fails hard.

Run on the Pi:  python3 scripts/run_dashboard_smoke.py
