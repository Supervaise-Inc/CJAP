"""Personas — both characters loaded at boot, one active (2026-09-10).

Two Reachy Mini units, two characters:

* ``cjap`` — Chief Justice Panganiban. Composes live from the corpus
  (router + composer), speaks with the cloned ElevenLabs voice
  ``ELEVEN_VOICE_ID``. Prompt: ``corpus/voice/voice_card.md``.
* ``host`` — the Host. Never composes, never runs the router or the
  composer. One pre-rendered intro line (rotating variants), pre-rendered
  duet playback, then silent. Authoring brief: ``corpus/voice/host_card.md``
  (used by the render scripts, never as a runtime prompt). Voice:
  ``ELEVEN_HOST_VOICE_ID`` — used by the render scripts AND live: ``activate()``
  points ``voice.config.ELEVEN_VOICE_ID`` at it and ``voice/speak.py`` re-reads
  that attribute on every synthesis, so a stale id here makes every live Host
  line (intro, host-asks, /maintain say-text) come out in the wrong voice with
  no error at all — 2026-09-12: the second robot ran a stale one all day.

Which machine plays which is ``cjap_is`` (alpha | beta), held by the lease
authority (dashboard/console.py) and delivered to each robot in its lease
reply. Both cards and both voice ids are loaded here at boot so a switch is
``activate()`` — no restart, no corpus reload. When the authority is
unreachable the robot keeps its last known persona (losing the mic is
safe; losing the persona mid-sentence is not) — that is floor_lease's job;
this module just makes activation cheap and idempotent.
