"""Voice loop: cloud STT/TTS + fillers + mic meter + storytelling gestures.

Modes:
  (default)  push-to-talk — Enter to speak
  --auto     hands-free, no wake word — answers any speech it hears
  --wake     hands-free with wake word — SLEEP until "Cee-Jap" (WW-5 matcher
             from app/wake_word.py), perk, capture one question, answer,
             back to SLEEP. Wake STT runs on OpenAI whisper-1 (the "local"
             faster-whisper backend is NOT installed on the Pi); windows are
             RMS-gated so silence never triggers an API call.
             STOP WORD (openwakeword backend only): the same phrase spoken
             WHILE the answer plays cuts playback and goes straight back to
             listening — see StopWord / config.STOP_OWW_THRESHOLD.
