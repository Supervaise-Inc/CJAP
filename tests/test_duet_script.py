"""The duet script and its renderer (2026-09-12).

DUET mode trades PRE-RENDERED lines between the two robots with no microphone
and no network — the attract loop for an empty room, and the fallback when the
venue router dies. These lines are words written ahead of time for a living
person, so they carry exactly the fidelity risk the live pipeline exists to
avoid: every one of them declares where its phrasing comes from, and no line
may assert a specific the corpus cannot back.
